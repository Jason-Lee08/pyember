# Ember Context System

## Overview

The Ember Context System provides a lightweight, zero-overhead approach to component discovery and dependency management. This redesigned system eliminates circular dependencies, improves thread safety, and enhances performance while significantly reducing complexity.

## Core Design Principles

- **Single Core Abstraction**: A thread-local registry is the only global mechanism
- **Self-Registering Components**: Components register themselves on creation
- **Lazy Initialization**: Components initialize only when first accessed
- **Direct Component Interaction**: Components find each other through the registry
- **Thread Isolation**: Thread-local storage eliminates most contention

## Key Components

### Registry

The `Registry` is the only global abstraction in the system. It provides a thread-local dictionary that components use to discover each other.

```python
from ember.core.context import Registry

# Get current thread's registry
registry = Registry.current()

# Register a component
registry.register("my_component", component_instance)

# Get a component
component = registry.get("my_component")
```

### Component Base Class

The `Component` base class provides common functionality for all components:

- Lazy initialization with proper locking
- Self-registration in the registry
- Thread-local registry access

```python
from ember.core.context import Component

class MyComponent(Component):
    def _register(self):
        """Register in registry."""
        self._registry.register("my_component", self)
    
    def _initialize(self):
        """Initialize lazily."""
        # Initialization logic
```

### Core Components

The system includes these core components:

- **ConfigComponent**: Configuration management
- **ModelComponent**: Model discovery and creation
- **DataComponent**: Dataset management
- **MetricsComponent**: Performance metrics collection

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from ember.core.context.config import ConfigComponent
from ember.core.context.model import ModelComponent

# Create components (automatically register in thread-local registry)
config = ConfigComponent()
model = ModelComponent()

# Use components
model_instance = model.get_model("my_model")
```

### Testing with Isolated Registry

```python
from ember.core.context import scoped_registry
from ember.core.context.model import ModelComponent

# Create isolated registry for test
with scoped_registry() as registry:
    # Create component with explicit registry
    model = ModelComponent(registry)
    
    # Register mock model
    model.register_model("test_model", MockModel())
    
    # Test component
    result = model.get_model("test_model").generate("test")
```

### Temporary Component Replacement

```python
from ember.core.context import temp_component

# Temporarily replace a component
with temp_component("model", mock_model):
    # Code that uses model
    # Will use mock_model inside this block
```

## Thread Safety

Thread safety is achieved through:

1. **Thread-Local Storage**: Each thread has its own isolated registry
2. **Double-Checked Locking**: Efficient lazy initialization pattern
3. **Fine-Grained Locking**: Component-specific locks for minimal contention

## Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Description | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Registry access | Thread-local lookup | ~5ns |
| Component lookup | Registry dictionary lookup | ~10ns |
| Component first use | Lazy initialization | ~100Î¼s |
| Thread scalability | Near-linear scaling | 7.9x @ 8 threads |

## Compatibility Layer

For existing code that depends on the old `EmberContext` API, a compatibility layer is provided:

```python
from ember.core.context.compatibility import current_context

# Get current context (old API)
ctx = current_context()

# Use old API methods
model = ctx.get_model("my_model")
```

However, new code should use the direct component APIs instead.
